Dumper is similar to Node.js [util.inspect](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#utilinspectobject-options) but it provides more control over the output. You can use Dumper to generate HTML output, CLI output, or use its low-level API to create inspection tokens and render them using a custom formatter.
